                <h1>Flexbox Crash Course</h1>
                <p>Natalie was supposed to finish this crash course
                    awhile ago but she's been procrastinatng a lot.
                    She has been very tired and is doing all she can
                    at the moment. But soon, I know she'll be able to 
                    focus and grind (code) everyday. Or I hope she will
                    because I'm tired of this fucking job.

                <p>
                    Natalie is spending an hour learning Spanish everyday. She
                    can't tell if it's working, but she knows the most Spanish
                    she's ever known. She is still a gringa tho pero ella est√°
                    aprendiendo.

                <h2><i class="fas fa-arrows-alt"></i>Reading Books</h2>
                <p>
                    Natalie has started reading on the trains again. She hopes
                    that by reading her old favorite books, she'll return to 
                    herself and find her peace. But sometimes she feels like
                    falling asleep while reading. And her attention span is shot out.

                <p>
                    Natalie has been going to the gym again. Though she's been
                    inconsistent, this is the most she's ever gone since February.
                    She's tryna get slim thiickkk. Key word is tryna.
